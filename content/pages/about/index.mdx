# Hello world!

I'm Son Nguyen. A software engineer in Ho Chi Minh city.

I am enthusiastic about new technologies and enjoy working in a fast-paced yet professional environment where I get to work with both like-minded people as well as other types who I can learn from.

> Technical stack
* Javascript, Go, Python
* AWS, Docker
* CI/CD with gitlabCI, Jenkins...

Open to learn some thing new from over SEA.
