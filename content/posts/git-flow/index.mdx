### Some key takeaways to know about Gitflow are:

The workflow is great for a release-based software workflow.
Gitflow offers a dedicated channel for hotfixes to production.


### The overall flow of Gitflow is

1. A develop branch is created from main

2. A release branch is created from develop

3. Feature branches are created from develop

4. When a feature is complete it is merged into the develop branch

5. When the release branch is done it is merged into develop and main

6. If an issue in main is detected a hotfix branch is created from main

7. Once the hotfix is complete it is merged to both develop and main
